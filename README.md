project to send issues to a repo using authentication and github API


We are redirecting users to github for authentication.

Once authenticated we are making a post request in the else if loop in the handler in app.js file under ` else if(req.url.match(/^(\/makepost\/)/)){ ` 

But our post request does not return correct response back from github.

This is where we are stuck!!!


Help!!!!
